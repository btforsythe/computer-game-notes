# Craft the World

## TODOs

- [ ] a **backpack** for every dwarf!
- [ ] Create one training area for each dwarf. Dwarves will train automatically when they're not busy.
- re-equip dwarves when portals open (this also gives an opportunity to revisit equipment)
  - [ ] **(un)equip fire/silver/special arrows!**
  - [ ] shields for warriors (minimum), or **everyone** (old shields for others, probably?)
  - [ ] whetstones (?) for warriors
  - [ ] gloves for archers
  - [ ] bags of elixir for mages
  - [ ] leather (or chitin) armors for non-warriors

## Regularly check:

- [ ] food available

## Remember:

- Agility is simply how fast your dwarves move. See [armor per agility reduction](https://crafttheworld.gamepedia.com/Armors#Armor_per_agility_reduction) on the Craft the World wiki. For non-warriors:
  - leather (or chitin) armor in general
  - iron boots (or chitin)
  - probably best helmet available is fine (low agility impact)
  - mages and archers can't use shields
- build railways outward from elevator shafts
- multiple cars can travel on the same rail
- stockpiles + totems

### Hotkeys

- P to pause (mana regeneration still runs -- bug?)
- Ctrl+Click to max out food on table
