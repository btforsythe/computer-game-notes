# Craft the World

## Regularly check

- food available
- dwarfs' equipment

## Checklist for what to do next

- dwarfs' equipment
  - picks and axes
  - backpacks
  - accessories
  - armor
- tech tree

## Remember

- *Always* be smithing/crafting!
- Maintain a list (on paper) of the number of dwarfs having each skill.
- Create one training area for each dwarf. Dwarves will train automatically when they're not busy.
- re-equip dwarves when portals open (this also gives an opportunity to revisit equipment)
  - **(un)equip fire/silver/special arrows!**
  - shields for warriors (minimum), or **everyone** (old shields for others, probably?)
  - whetstones (?) for warriors
  - gloves for archers
  - bags of elixir for mages
- leather (or chitin) armor for non-warriors (agility impact)
  - helmets and boots aren't a big agility impact
- a **backpack** for every dwarf!
- Stick torches everywhere. Slime torches are essentially free.
- Agility is simply how fast your dwarves move. See [armor per agility reduction](https://crafttheworld.gamepedia.com/Armors#Armor_per_agility_reduction) on the Craft the World wiki. For non-warriors:
  - leather (or chitin) armor in general
  - iron boots (or chitin)
  - probably best helmet available is fine (low agility impact)
  - mages and archers can't use shields
- build railways outward from elevator shafts
- multiple cars can travel on the same rail
- stockpiles + totems

### Hotkeys

- P to pause (mana regeneration still runs -- bug?)
- Ctrl+Click to max out food on table
